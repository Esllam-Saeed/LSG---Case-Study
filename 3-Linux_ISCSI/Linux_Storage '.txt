                                                                  LVM, NFS, and iSCSI.


Regarding NFS :

                   imagine you are working in call center company with around 3000  and you have around 100 shared folder and as you know call center 
               agents come and gone , I think you put your hand on the problem , right How can IT handle a lot of sharing requests ?
                     sure totally agree with your solution : is create  2 groups for every shared folder but what if make these
               groups managed by team leader or every manager department he will responsible for add or remove team members to groups


my role here  :
                    is how to manage my work and raise my hand from my role here is how to manage my work and raise my hand from unnecessary work



Iscsi    
 as i told you before I dealt with it on with 3 type of storage Freenas and qnap vsan     
one of my experience here when i upgrade freenas to the last version i faced problem with ISCSI services ? what if I downgrade again and had the same issue 
          

my role 
          face new problems and try to fix it instead of turn back .
