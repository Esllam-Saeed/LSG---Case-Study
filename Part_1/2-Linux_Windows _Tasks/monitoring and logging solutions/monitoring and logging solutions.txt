 I was responsible for monitoring solution to monitor all devices in my company, microsoft has solution to manage and monitoring is called SCCM. take a moment and think about 
licence , VM  resorces for example MS recommend Min 95 G RAM. I implement Zabbix and tested it then migerated it from testing environment to production.
I got promtion regarding this 

OpenSource and Free application           

your question now How about servers , right ?

there are a new solution called prometheus . prometheus is data source, I deployed it then used Grafana as data visualization for dashboards.
 Syslog server I tested it on Devops diploma but in production usually i use IBM products.

my role here is not only find best solutions , Save company money and resource , my thinking way not only as a technical.
