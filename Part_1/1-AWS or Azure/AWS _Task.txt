Summary:

Designing a network with 2 Linux servers and 2 databases involves creating a secure and efficient infrastructure for storing and managing data.
The 2 Linux servers can be configured as web servers to host web applications and serve user requests, while the 2 databases can be used to store and manage 
the underlying data.
it is important to properly balance the load between the servers, and to configure appropriate network security measures,such as Security group and access controls. 
In addition,it is important to implement cloud watch monitoring and logging systems to monitor the health of the network and ensure that
 any issues can be quickly identified and resolved.


Steps:
  * Web Servers:
    - Launch 2 EC2 instances with a suitable instance type, such as t2.micro, to run the web servers.
    - Assign each instance to a different availability zone to achieve high availability.
    - Install a web server software, such as Apache or Nginx, on each instance to serve web content.
    - Configure a load balancer, such as Elastic Load Balancer, in front of the web servers to distribute incoming traffic and provide failover capabilities.
    - Attach an elastic IP address to each web server to ensure a fixed public IP address.

 * Databases:
    - Launch 2 RDS instances with a suitable database engine, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL .
    - Assign each instance to a different availability zone to achieve high availability.
    - Create a database for each instance and configure the required tables and permissions.
    - Secure the database instances by restricting the access to specific IP addresses or subnets and enabling encryption at rest.
 * Networking:
 - Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate the network environment and control the traffic flow.
 - Create a public subnet for the load balancer and a private subnet for the web servers .
 - Configure a routing table for the public subnet to route internet traffic through an Internet Gateway.
 - Configure a security group for the web servers and databases to control inbound and outbound traffic.
 - Create a database security group to allow access to the databases only from the web servers.

The following tools and services are required :
Amazon Web Services account
EC2 instances for web servers
RDS instances for databases
Load balancer
VPC and subnets
Internet Gateway
Security groups
Elastic IP addresses
cloud watch
route53
auto scaling 
CloudTrail  "Elasticsearch, Amazon Kibana, and Amazon Logstash"

End users can connect to the web servers through the load balancer's public IP address. To ensure a secure connection.
